\subsection*{Summary}

A motivated and organised Environmental Science final year student currently studying at the University of the West of England. Due to my hospitality experience, I excel working under pressure and I am a good multitasker. I always maintain a positive attitude and believe I can bring energy and charisma into my work life. I can work well both in a team and on my own as I am independent and a self-starter. 

\subsection*{Education}


\centry{BSc(Hons) Environmental Science}{University of the West of England}{2017--2020}
 Achieved the highest course marks in first year, 2:1 in second year and predicted 2:1 in third year.
Modules taken:
Research Dissertation Project (64%) I studied the changes in Arctic lakes by using satellite data within ArcGIS. I also compared accuracies of different land use classification methods from data acquired from different satellites. 
Environmental Microbiology (69%) where I developed laboratory skills, studied bioremediation, wastewater treatment processes, microbial ecology and biotechnology. Developed my understanding of alternative energy production methods by reviewing and writing a report on microbial fuel cells.
Atmosphere and Climate (71%) where I gained practical experience of a range of analytical and modelling techniques utilised in climate science, gained experience of atmospheric modelling and understood and evaluated the risks associated with air pollution and climate change.
Remote sensing and GIS (69%) where I imported environmental data into GIS packages, applied GIS to the presentation and analysis of remotely sensed data. For example, mapping the theoretical flood heights and creating an ArcGIS StoryMaps presentation to show the data.
Energy Technologies where I critically assessed different energy technologies with respect to climate mitigation and the socioeconomic challenges they face. I assessed the future of the UK’s energy production especially regarding the target of reaching net zero carbon emissions by 2050. 
Resource Security and Sustainability where I developed my understanding of environmental policies and concepts such as circular economy as well as experience in environmental modelling. 
Ecology and Ecosystem Protection (61%) where I developed field skills by, for example, undertaking a Phase 1 habitat survey. Performed statistical analysis on environmental data using R.
